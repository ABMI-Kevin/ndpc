# Discussion

The protocol outlined above provides a standardized method for conducting digital avian point counts using ARUs or handheld recording devices. By integrating acoustic technology with traditional point count surveys, this protocol has the potential to significantly augment the data quality and integrity of avian monitoring programs in Canada. Some considerations for further improvement and review of this protocol are:

- Validation of the effectiveness of ARUs in detecting bird species compared to human observers. It would be beneficial to conduct validation studies to compare the accuracy and reliability of ARUs with human observers in detecting bird species during point count surveys. This could help establish the confidence level in using ARUs as a reliable method for data collection.
- Standardization of data processing and analysis methods. As the use of ARUs for avian monitoring is a relatively new approach, there may be variations in data processing and analysis methods among different research groups or monitoring programs. It would be useful to establish standardized methods for processing and analyzing acoustic data, including the use of speech-to-text recognizers, to ensure consistency and comparability of results across different studies or programs.
- Training and capacity-building for citizen scientists. The use of ARUs in avian monitoring has the potential to involve citizen scientists in data collection efforts, but it may also require training and capacity-building to ensure accurate data collection and recording. Providing resources, training materials, and support for citizen scientists who participate in digital avian point counts could help improve the quality and reliability of the data collected.
- Regular updates and improvements to equipment and technology. As technology evolves, there may be new advancements in ARUs or other recording devices that could improve the quality and efficiency of data collection. Regular updates and improvements to equipment and technology should be considered to ensure that the most current and effective tools are being used for avian monitoring efforts.
