Welcome to the protocol for conducting a **digital point count** using an autonomous recording unit or handheld recording device. In collaboration with partners from [Environment and Climate Change Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change.html), the [Ontario Breeding Bird Atlas](https://www.birdsontario.org/), the [Bioacoustic Unit](http://bioacoustic.abmi.ca/), the [Alberta Biodiversity Monitoring Institute](https://abmi.ca/home.html) and the [Boreal Avian Modeling Project](https://borealbirds.ca/), this user-friendly protocol aims to establish a standard method for collecting data on avian populations in a digital format, making it accessible and easy for citizen scientists to collect and contribute to avian research and population monitoring.

```{r, eval=F, include=F, warning=F, message=F} 

# locs <- dir_ls(".", recurse = T, regexp = "Locations") %>%
#   map_dfr(~read_csv(.)) %>%
#   select(location, latitude, longitude)
# 
# pcs <- dir_ls(".", recurse = T, regexp = "Tasks") %>%
#   map_dfr(~read_csv(.)) %>%
#   select(location, recordingDate) %>%
#   inner_join(., locs, by = c("location" = "location")) %>%
#   filter(!is.na(latitude)) %>%
#   mutate(year = year(recordingDate)) %>%
#   sample_frac(0.03) %>%
#   st_as_sf(coords = c("longitude","latitude")) %>%
#   st_make_valid() %>%
#   st_set_crs(4269)

# mymap <- ggplot() +
#    coord_sf(crs = 4269) +
#    geom_sf(pcs, mapping = aes(colour = year)) +
#    theme_bw() +
#    scale_colour_viridis_c() +
#    theme(legend.position = "none",
#          axis.text.x = element_blank(),
#          axis.text.y = element_blank()) +
#    ggtitle('Date of Survey: {closest_state}',
#            subtitle = "Total counts: {frame}%") +
#    transition_states(states = recordingDate, transition_length = 2, state_length = 1, wrap = T) +
#    shadow_mark(past = TRUE, alpha = 1) +
#    ease_aes('cubic-in-out') +
#    enter_fade()
# 
# anim_save("./images/map.gif", mymap, width=600, height=300, duration=5)
