  BAR_LT = c("Yes", "Difficult", "Expensive ($ 1 000)", "Moderate (900 g)", "Many", "Yes"),
  row.names = c("Autonomous", "Ease-of-use", "Price", "Weight", "Advanced features", "GPS tracking")
)

# Create kable table
kable(df, format = "html", align = "c", row.names = TRUE) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = FALSE) %>%
  column_spec(1, bold = TRUE) %>%
  footnote(number = c("Autonomous; refers to the ability for the recorder to turn on and off without human intervention for set periods."))

```

### General equipment care

Always handle any equipment with care. Recorders contain sensitive electronic components that will not withstand crushing or heavy impacts. Do not use excess force to manipulate components and do all operations gently. See more on handling equipment in [wet weather](#wet-weather).

## Equipment and settings preparation

Calibration and testing of equipment prior to conducting a survey is essential for collecting high-quality acoustic data.

### H2N equipment setup

Ensure firmware is the most recent version.

```{r, include = T, eval = T, echo=F}
library(downloadthis)

download_file(path = "./data/H2n_v3.00E.zip", button_label = "Download Zoom H2N Firmware", has_icon=T, icon = "fa fa-save", self_contained=F)
```

<br>

The following additional equipment is required in order to conduct the survey protocol:

- 1 SD card; a 32 GB card will allow you to collect ~1,000 3-minute audio recordings
- 2x AA batteries (pack at least 2 spare AA batteries)
- Windsock
- Tripod

#### Settings

The following settings will allow you to easily record and integrate data with other Zoom recordings:

##### Setting the date and time {.unnumbered}

- Turn on the device using the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Power</span> switch.
- Press the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Menu</span> button, toggle the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Play</span> button up/down and then press down to select <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">System</span>. 
- Select <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Date/Time</span>
- Use the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Play</span> button to select and modify the year, day, month, and time settings as needed. 
- When all settings are correct, select <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">OK</span> and press the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Play</span> button to exit. 

##### Defaulting to date and time file names {.unnumbered}

Ensure that <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Filename</span> (under <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Rec</span> settings) is set to <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Date</span> so that individual files will be named by the date/time of the start of recording, e.g. `230604-053010` which corresponds to the year, month day, hour, minute and second the recording started. Do not use <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Default</span>.

##### Audio settings {.unnumbered}

Ensure the recorder uses the following settings:

- <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">2CH</span> selected on channel selector dial
- <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Mic Gain</span> set to `10` (maximum)
- <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Surround</span> is set to `S±0`. This is *really easy to change by accident*, because it is changed by moving the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Play</span> lever while in <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Record</span> mode)
- <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Rec Format</span> is set at <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Wav</span> (when you turn on the recorder, the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Rec</span> format is displayed on the lower left [e.g., 44.1/16]. If it doesn’t match, go to <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Menu</span> to change it under <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Rec</span> settings)
- Use `44.1kHz/16 bit` (there are other wav settings that would also work but use a little or a lot more memory). Do not use MP3. 

<br>
<img align="left" src="./images/zoomsettings.png" width="680" height="680">
<br>

Other audio settings include:

- <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Auto Rec</span> is <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Off</span>

## Conducting the survey

Conducting the survey is the core piece of work that you'll be doing. This is when you will be placing the recorder at a designed [location](#locations) on the landscape in order to capture the soundscape for a given duration. 

There are two different types of recording method that can be used throughout a survey route: [**continuous**](#continuous-recording) and [**segmented**](#segmented-recording).

### Segmented recording

The **segmented** recording method indicates you will be turning the recorder on and off at each location along a survey route. Segmented recording is the most popular method for on and off-road deployments. The advantage is that you will only accumulate data and recording for the intended period during the point count. In general, a segmented recording method will involve the following steps, but refer to each subsection specific to a recorder make and model.

- Arrive at a survey location and follow safety instructions outlined by the designated point count protocol.
- Set up the recorder at a fixed location, keeping it at a minimum distance of 5 meters away from the observer to minimize observer sounds, but no more than 20 meters away to minimize error. A tripod or stable surface is recommended to support the ARU; do not place the recorder on or near a vehicle as it will pick up vibrations that could mask species detections. Placing the recorder to the rear of the vehicle can also minimize the sounds made from a vehicle engine (e.g. car, truck, quad, etc.) after it is shut off.
- Turn on the unit and speak the designated voice note. Move away from the recorder to begin the count and say <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Start</span>
- At the end of the count, speak <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Stop</span>.
- Turn off the recorder and move to the next location. Repeat steps as necessary to conduct more surveys along a route

:::{.rmdwarning}
Do not to speak during the point count survey itself to limit erroneous speech errors picked up by the speech-to-text recognizer
:::

#### H2N segmented survey deployment

- Initiate the survey by pressing the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Record</span> button on the recorder.
- Speak a clear message into the recorder to serve as the voicestamp, including observer name, location (spatial coordinates or identifier), and optional date and time stamp.
- Move 5-20 meters away from the recorder to reduce observer noise.
- Say <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Start</span> to indicate the end of the speech-to-text recording and move away from the recorder

#### SM Micro segmented survey deployment

<span style="color:grey;font-style:italic">Coming soon!</span>

#### BAR-LT segmented survey deployment

<span style="color:grey;font-style:italic">Coming soon!</span>


### Continuous recording

In the **continuous** recording method, you will be turning the recorder on at the beginning of a survey route, and turning it off at the end of a survey route. A survey route can include many [locations](#locations). For example, a Breeding Bird Survey route may be conducting using a continuous recording method, allowing you to focus time on conducting point counts.

:::{.rmdwarning}
Only SM4 and BAR-LT are currently supported for the continuous recording method.

**Please note that this unit will continuously and indiscriminately record and capture all sounds. We kindly request that you use discretion and be mindful of what is being recorded out of respect for your own privacy and the privacy of others.**
:::

- Arrive at the beginning of the survey route and follow safety instructions outlined by the designated point count protocol.
- Turn on the recorder and speak the designated voice note. Move away from the recorder to begin the count and say <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Start</span>
- At the end of the count, speak <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Stop</span>.
- Move to the next location along the survey route. Repeat steps as necessary. Verify at *each location* the recorder is still active.
- At the end of the survey location, turn off the recorder.

### Survey length adjustment

Surveys are supposed to be a certain length. Surveys may occur along roadsides, near areas of loud anthropogenic noise, or interrupted by intermittent or inclement weather. In order to optimize species detections in the detection radius of the ARU, survey time can be extended by 1 minute per event up to maximum survey length time of 10 minutes (or in the case of Marshbird Monitoring Protocol, 15-minutes). 

It’s recommended to keep a stopwatch or phone timer set to the length of the survey interval, and the maximum survey interval so you don’t have to keep track of the events specifically but rather the time you can survey for. 

For example, if a vehicle is passing, extend the survey for up to one minute.

![](images/vehicle.png)

Geophonic events are similar; if it becomes too windy or rainy to continue the survey, i.e. if geophonic events last for >10 minutes during the survey, the media will be considered [*Bad Weather*](https://www.wildtrax.ca/home/resources/guide/acoustic-data/acoustic-tagging-page.html). Surveys can be extended for 1 minute at a time for intermittent periods of rain or wind.

:::{.rmdnote}
It's possible the survey is taking place in an environment when anthropogenic noise can't be avoid. In this case, survey for the standard amount of time dictated by your protocol.
:::

### Wet weather

Extra care is required to handle ARUs in wet weather. When units such as Song Meters are closed, they are water tight and can withstand most weather conditions in the field. However, do not get water inside on the electronic components or into the external microphone sockets. Water will short out the electrical circuits and may cause permanent damage to the units.

Take extra care on activation and deactivation on rainy days. Having wet hands, gloves and clothing will make it difficult to keep the inside of the equipment dry. Try to minimize the amount of time an ARU is exposed should you encounter inclement weather.

## Metadata

### Locations

In the context of this protocol, a **location** is a single physical, geographic place at which a digital point count is collected and/or biological data was collected on the landscape. They are one of the most important components as media and metadata are linked by the location.

![](./images/locations.png)

### Voice notes

Voice notes serve as an effective tool for capturing spatial and temporal information on each recording. It is not essential that users follow a specific speaking order, but a voice note must include at a mininum:

- Observer's name
- [Location](#locations) name
- Date and time

Here is an example of a voice note for a named location:

```{r setup, include = FALSE, echo=F}
html_tag_audio <- function(file, type = c("wav")) {
  type <- match.arg(type)
  htmltools::tags$audio(
    controls = "",
    htmltools::tags$source(
      src = file,
      type = glue::glue("audio/{type}", type = type)
    )
  )
}
```

```{r, echo=F}
html_tag_audio("./assets/reprex.wav", type = "wav")
```

<br>

If the location is new, it is also necessary to provide latitude and longitude coordinates. Here is an example of an off-road or new location voice note:

```{r, echo=F}
html_tag_audio("./assets/reprex.wav", type = "wav")
```

<br>

Creating a standard file name format after processing the voice note is done through speech-to-text recognition. For example, the format for [Zoom](#h2n-equipment-setup) recordings should be in `YYMMDD` (year, month, day), and the time should be in `HHMMSS` (hour, minute, second) format. The resulting file name format after the processing will be in the following format: `LOCATION_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.wav`.

#### Speech-to-text

*This is A B M I dash Five Six Five dash S W. The date is February 23rd 2022 and the time is 11:06 AM Mountain standard time. Observers are John Doe and Jane Doe*

A speech-to-text recognizer is used to transcribe the voice note into text information in order to extract the location name, spatial coordinates or confirm the temporal stamp of the ARU, all for quality control purposes. The [Google Cloud Speech-to-Text](https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text) recognizer is an advanced deep learning neural network using algorithms for automatic speech recognition. The recognizer can also use one of several machine learning models to transcribe the audio files, support for French and other language variants, and alternatives based on likelihood values. Google has trained these speech recognition models for specific audio types and sources. 

For example, time stamps derived from the observer speech-to-text array as well as the recording time stamp from the audio would be joined into to create a unique location and recording date with the file prefix from the ARU.

### Data accumulation

This app should help to determine how much data you should collect approximately for a season.

```{r, echo=F}
knitr::include_app("https://agmacpha.shinyapps.io/volume_calc/",
  height = "400px")

```

## Data submission

Cirrus is a server administered by the [University of Alberta SRIT](https://spaces.facsci.ualberta.ca/cirrus/about-us/). The Bioacoustic Unit and its collaborators use Cirrus to house and standardize their acoustic data sets for redundancy or permanent storage on a cost-recovery basis. Cirrus contains a variety of different types of data but a large majority of the volume is currently being occupied with environmental sensor data i.e. acoustic recordings and remote camera images. 

Raw recordings uploaded to Cirrus via an FTP in order to standardize them before they are processed in WildTrax. Download an FTP client like [Filezilla](https://filezilla-project.org/). Enter the following credentials:

:::{.rmdnote}
- **Host**: upload.wildtrax.ca or sftp://upload.wildtrax.ca
- **User**: eccc
- **Password**: w0rdb1rd
- **Port**: 22
:::

Organization > Project > Observer

```{r}
# OBBA <- The organization
# OBBA_2023 <- The project
# Jane_Doe <- The observer

```

<img align="left" src="images/zoomdata.png">

You can also place the recordings in a folder under the following hierarchy:

Organization > Sensor > Project > Year > Visit > *Group* > Location

```{r}
# BU <- The organization
# ARU <- The sensor 
# BUM  <- The field project, e.g. BUM = Bioacoustic Mobile
# 2022 <- The year of the study
# V1 <- The visit
# BUM-401 <- The location
# Below this level will be all the files for that location

```

Where *group* is a set of locations on the landscape. For example a Breeding Bird Survey route, e.g. `BBS-4239` would be a group and `BBS-4239-1` would be a location.

<img align="left" src="images/string.png" width="680" height="480">

### Metadata confirmation

- Ensure the file name convention of the recordings follows either `YYMMDD-HHMMSS` or `LOCATION_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS` format
- Ensure the folder structure follows the [standard hierarchy](#data-submission)
- If there are zero-length files or files smaller than the intended length of the count, **do not upload these files**

:::{.rmdwarning}
You can technically upload all recordings directly to a project on WildTrax provided you are given the correct privileges. If the FTP is not functioning, this is an alternative option.
:::

## Data processing in WildTrax

Once the recordings are trimmed to the correct length of time, ABMI staff will upload them to appropriate projects in WildTrax. Go to My Data -> My Projects and search for the appropriate project for your data.

<img align="left" src="images/project.png" width="575" height="500">

---

## Data publication

Once the project is completed, the status can be switched to one of the *published* statuses, allowing the public and other WildTrax users, as well as NatureCounts to receive data.
