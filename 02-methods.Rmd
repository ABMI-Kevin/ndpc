# Methods

## Selecting a recorder

Choose an affordable, available, and easy-to-use Acoustic Recording Unit (ARU) for large-scale programs such as BBS or an Atlas.

## Equipment and Settings Preparation

Calibration and testing of ARUs prior to conducting a survey is essential for high-quality acoustic data.

### H2N Equipment Setup

- Update firmware to the most recent version (3.0).
- Gather USB cables, SD cards, batteries, windsock, and tripod.
- Follow technical setup steps for Zoom H2N, including adjusting date/time settings, battery power, memory card space, and recording settings.

### SM4 Equipment Setup

## Conducting the Survey Protocol

- Arrive at survey location and follow safety instructions outlined by the point count protocol.
- Place ARU at a fixed location, minimum 5 meters away from the observer to minimize observer sounds and maximum 20 meters away to minimize error.
- Use a tripod or stable surface to support ARU and avoid placing it on or near a vehicle to prevent vibrations.

### H2N Survey Deployment

### SM4 Survey Deployment

### Recorder Activation and Voicestamp

- Initiate the survey by pressing the RECORD button on the ARU.
- Speak a clear message into the recorder to serve as the voicestamp, including observer name, location (spatial coordinates or identifier), and optional date and time stamp.
- Move 5-20 meters away from the recorder to reduce observer noise.
- Say "START" to indicate the end of the speech-to-text recording.

### Survey Length Adjustment

- Adjust the survey length based on anthropogenic or geophonic conditions to ensure accurate results.

## Data submission

- Turn on the device using the POWER switch. 
- Press the MENU button, toggle the PLAY button up/down and then press down to select SYSTEM. 
- Select DATE/TIME. 
- Use the PLAY button to select and modify the year, day, month, and time settings as needed. 
- When all settings are correct, select OK and press the PLAY button to exit. 
- Ensure that FILE NAME (under REC settings) is set to DATE so that individual files will be named by the date/time of the start of recording). Do not use DEFAULT. 
- Ensure the recorder has sufficient battery power to record all counts (and pack at least 2 spare AA batteries). 
- Ensure that there is a memory-card inserted with sufficient space (the bottom-right corner of the unit’s screen indicates the remaining time on the SD card). 
- Ensure the recorder uses the following settings:
  + 2CH selected on channel selector dial
  + MIC GAIN set to 10 (maximum)
  + SURROUND is set to S±0 (this is really easy to change by accident, because it is changed by moving the PLAY lever while in RECORD mode)
  + REC FORMAT is set at WAV (when you turn on the recorder, the REC format is displayed on the lower left [e.g., 44.1/16]– if it doesn’t match, go to MENU to change it under REC settings)
  + Use 44.1kHz/16 bit (there are other wav settings that would also work but use a little or a lot more memory). Do not use MP3
  + AUTO REC is OFF
  + LO CUT is ON (may be useful to reduce impacts of wind or traffic noise)
  + COMP/LIMITER is OFF
  + AUTO GAIN is off

Conduct the survey protocol
This next section outlines the mobile survey protocol in the field.

Equipment setup
Arrive at the survey location. Follow any safety instructions or measures outlined by your respective point count protocol (e.g. BBS, atlas)
Ensure at the beginning of each survey to place the ARU at a fixed place, a minimum distance of 5 metres away from the observer, to minimize observer sounds, but a maximum distance of 20 metres away, to minimize error between the detection radius of the ARU and observer. 
A tripod or stable surface is recommended to support the ARU; do not place the recorder on or near a vehicle as it will pick up vibrations that could mask species detections. 
Placing the recorder to the rear of the vehicle can also minimise the sounds made from a vehicle engine (e.g. car, truck, quad, etc.) after it is shut off.

Recorder activation and voicestamp
Initiate the survey by hitting the RECORD button (same type of button for the Zoom H2N and Wildlife Acoustics SM4)
Speak a message into the recorder to serve as the voicestamp. A location name or spatial coordinates or identifier must be provided.  Speak as clearly as possible.

Conduct the survey for the duration indicated by project design. If you need to stop during the survey for traffic, do not turn off the unit until the end of the extended survey (see next section)
Do not to speak during the survey to limit erroneous speech errors picked up by the speech-to-text recognizer
At the end of the count, speak STOP.

Recorder deactivation
Turn off the recorder and move to the next location. Repeat steps as necessary to conduct more surveys along a route

Adjust survey length for anthropogenic or geophonic conditions
Surveys may occur along roadsides or near areas of loud anthropogenic noise. In order to optimize species detections in the detection radius of the ARU, survey time can be extended by 1 minute per traffic event up to maximum survey length time of 10 minutes. It’s recommended to keep a stopwatch or phone timer set to the length of the survey interval,  and the maximum survey interval so you don’t have to keep track of the traffic events specifically but rather the time you can survey for. Geophonic events are similar. If it becomes too windy or rainy to continue the survey, i.e. if geophonic events last for >10 minutes during the survey, the media will be considered “Bad Weather”. However, surveys can be extended for 1 minute at a time for intermittent periods of rain or wind.
