One approach conduct regular surveys bird populations specific locations, wetlands, forests, grasslands. surveys can carried trained volunteers professional biologists, can involve visual observations, bird counts, use recording equipment capture bird sounds. Another approach use citizen science programs, members public can report observations wild birds central database. can provide valuable information distribution abundance different bird species Canada. Additionally, conservation organizations government agencies often programs place monitor wild birds habitats, can provide valuable resources interested monitoring wild birds Canada. North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) long-term, road-based survey designed collect quantitative data avian population trends across continent (Hudson et al. 2017). Provincial atlases aim collect data volunteers, researchers, consultants, NGOs provincial federal government partnerships assess current status breeding birds map distribution relative abundance provincial scale (Cadman et al. 1987) time atlases repeated. Results sources drive decision-making, conservation policy planning provide indicators environmental climate change Canada.Augmentation avian data collection autonomous recording units (ARUs) along traditional survey routes potential increase detection rates, reduce false positives human observers, well easily increase sampling remote locations (Pankratz et al. 2017). Acoustic technology becoming increasingly affordable (Shonfield et al. 2017) allowing researchers public actively collect high quality acoustic information environment. differences humans ARUs avian surveys well-studied (Darras et al. 2018, Pankratz et al. 2017, Shonfield Bayne 2017, Van Wilgenburg et al. 2017, Venier et al. 2017, Turgeon et al. 2017, Yip et al. 2019), effectively use large-scale, long-term monitoring program less understood. Establishing standardized method actively record environment simultaneously conducting point counts significantly augment data quality integrity breeding bird survey data needed. possible, integrating accurate point count acoustic species processing point count survey data synthesise improved protocol towards avian monitoring Canada making accessible citizen scientists collect avian data without expert. Data quality augmentation can occur aligning metadata location accuracy, anthropogenic geophonic events observed species detections point counts.","code":""},{"path":"methods.html","id":"methods","chapter":"2 Methods","heading":"2 Methods","text":"Table 1 - Protocol conducting digital point countProtocol conducting digital point count\nSelect recorder model\nPrepare equipment settings\nConduct point count survey\nAdjust survey length anthropogenic geophonic conditions\nRun speech--text recognizer\nUpload trimmed recordings WildTraxSelect recorder model\nARUs must affordable, available easy use used large-scale program BBS Atlas. project use Zoom H2N Wildlife Acoustics SM4 models ARUs due availability, ease use, durability environment.
