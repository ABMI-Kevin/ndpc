# Methods

## Selecting a recorder

Choose an affordable, available, and easy-to-use Acoustic Recording Unit (ARU) for large-scale programs such as BBS or an Atlas.

- [Zoom H2Ns]() is a handheld portable recorder with built-in microphones offering a variety of recording features at an affordable price point.

## Equipment and Settings Preparation

Calibration and testing of ARUs prior to conducting a survey is essential for high-quality acoustic data.

### H2N Equipment Setup

- Update firmware to the most recent version (3.0).
- Gather USB cables, SD cards, batteries, windsock, and tripod.
- Follow technical setup steps for Zoom H2N, including adjusting date/time settings, battery power, memory card space, and recording settings.


- Turn on the device using the POWER switch. 
- Press the MENU button, toggle the PLAY button up/down and then press down to select SYSTEM. 
- Select DATE/TIME. 
- Use the PLAY button to select and modify the year, day, month, and time settings as needed. 
- When all settings are correct, select OK and press the PLAY button to exit. 
- Ensure that FILE NAME (under REC settings) is set to DATE so that individual files will be named by the date/time of the start of recording). Do not use DEFAULT. 
- Ensure the recorder has sufficient battery power to record all counts (and pack at least 2 spare AA batteries). 
- Ensure that there is a memory-card inserted with sufficient space (the bottom-right corner of the unit’s screen indicates the remaining time on the SD card). 
- Ensure the recorder uses the following settings:
  + 2CH selected on channel selector dial
  + MIC GAIN set to 10 (maximum)
  + SURROUND is set to S±0 (this is really easy to change by accident, because it is changed by moving the PLAY lever while in RECORD mode)
  + REC FORMAT is set at WAV (when you turn on the recorder, the REC format is displayed on the lower left [e.g., 44.1/16]– if it doesn’t match, go to MENU to change it under REC settings)
  + Use 44.1kHz/16 bit (there are other wav settings that would also work but use a little or a lot more memory). Do not use MP3
  + AUTO REC is OFF
  + LO CUT is ON (may be useful to reduce impacts of wind or traffic noise)
  + COMP/LIMITER is OFF
  + AUTO GAIN is off

## Conducting the Survey Protocol

- Arrive at survey location and follow safety instructions outlined by the point count protocol.
- Set up the recorder at a fixed location, keeping it at a minimum distance of 5 meters away from the observer to minimize observer sounds, but no more than 20 meters away to minimize error. A tripod or stable surface is recommended to support the ARU; do not place the recorder on or near a vehicle as it will pick up vibrations that could mask species detections. Placing the recorder to the rear of the vehicle can also minimise the sounds made from a vehicle engine (e.g. car, truck, quad, etc.) after it is shut off.
- Turn on the unit and speak the designated voice note. Move away from the recorder to begin the count and say "START"
- At the end of the count, speak STOP.
- Turn off the recorder and move to the next location. Repeat steps as necessary to conduct more surveys along a route

### H2N Survey Deployment

- Initiate the survey by pressing the RECORD button on the recorder.
- Speak a clear message into the recorder to serve as the voicestamp, including observer name, location (spatial coordinates or identifier), and optional date and time stamp.
- Move 5-20 meters away from the recorder to reduce observer noise.
- Say "START" to indicate the end of the speech-to-text recording and move away from the recorder

### Survey Length Adjustment

Adjust survey length for anthropogenic or geophonic conditions
Surveys may occur along roadsides or near areas of loud anthropogenic noise. In order to optimize species detections in the detection radius of the ARU, survey time can be extended by 1 minute per traffic event up to maximum survey length time of 10 minutes. It’s recommended to keep a stopwatch or phone timer set to the length of the survey interval,  and the maximum survey interval so you don’t have to keep track of the traffic events specifically but rather the time you can survey for. Geophonic events are similar. If it becomes too windy or rainy to continue the survey, i.e. if geophonic events last for >10 minutes during the survey, the media will be considered “Bad Weather”. However, surveys can be extended for 1 minute at a time for intermittent periods of rain or wind.

### Important Notes

- Do not to speak during the survey to limit erroneous speech errors picked up by the speech-to-text recognizer
