# Welcome

::: {.rmdnote}
This site is currently under construction to align with the 2023 field season
:::

Welcome to the protocol for conducting a **digital avian point count** using an autonomous recording unit or handheld recording device. In collaboration with partners from [Environment and Climate Change Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change.html), the [Breeding Bird Survey](https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/bird-surveys/landbird/north-american-breeding/overview.html), the [Ontario Breeding Bird Atlas](https://www.birdsontario.org/), the [Bioacoustic Unit](http://bioacoustic.abmi.ca/), the [Alberta Biodiversity Monitoring Institute](https://abmi.ca/home.html) and the [Boreal Avian Modeling Project](https://borealbirds.ca/), this user-friendly protocol aims to establish a standard method for collecting data on avian populations in a digital format, making it accessible and easy for citizen scientists to collect and contribute to avian research and population monitoring.

- Use of autonomous recording units (ARUs) and handheld recording devices to conduct avian point counts, in collaboration with leading avian research organizations
- Standardized protocol for data collection to ensure consistency and comparability of results, following established guidelines
- Digital format for data collection, making it easily accessible and shareable among researchers from various organizations
- Citizen scientists can participate in avian research and contribute to scientific knowledge
- No prior experience or expertise required, making it user-friendly for all skill levels, with support and guidance from experts

## The Basics {.unnumbered}

- [Select a point count protocol](#download-cheatsheets) for conducting a digital point count
- [Select a recorder model](#selecting-a-recorder)
- Prepare equipment and settings
- Conduct the point count surveys
  + Adjust survey length for anthropogenic or geophonic conditions
- Upload the recordings to a [central repository](#data-submission)
- Run the speech-to-text recognizer and standardize the recordings'*'
- Upload the trimmed recordings to [WildTrax]()'*'
- Process data
- Publish project and send data to [NatureCounts](#canavian)'*'
