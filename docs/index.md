# Welcome

::: {.rmdnote}
This page is currently under construction to align with the 2023 field season
:::

Welcome to the protocol for conducting a **digital avian point count** using an autonomous recording unit or handheld recording device. In collaboration with partners from [Environment and Climate Change Canada](), the [Breeding Bird Survey](), the [Ontario Breeding Bird Atlas](), the [Bioacoustic Unit](), the [Alberta Biodiversity Monitoring Institute]() and the [Boreal Avian Modeling Project](), this user-friendly protocol aims to establish a standard method for collecting data on avian populations in a digital format, making it accessible and easy for citizen scientists to collect and contribute to avian research and population monitoring.

- Use of autonomous recording units (ARUs) and handheld recording devices to conduct avian point counts, in collaboration with leading avian research organizations.
- Standardized protocol for data collection to ensure consistency and comparability of results, following established guidelines
- Digital format for data collection, making it easily accessible and shareable among researchers from various organizations.
- Citizen scientists can participate in avian research and contribute to scientific knowledge, working in partnership with established organizations
- No prior experience or expertise required, making it user-friendly for all skill levels, with support and guidance from expert stakeholders

## The Basics

- [Select a protocol](#download-cheatsheets) for conducting a digital point count
- [Select a recorder model](#selecting-a-recorder)
- Prepare equipment and settings
- Conduct the point count surveys
  + Adjust survey length for anthropogenic or geophonic conditions
- Upload the recordings to a [central repository](#data-submission)
- Run the speech-to-text recognizer and standardize the recordings (*Currently supported by the ABMI*)
- Upload the trimmed recordings to [WildTrax]() (*Currently supported by the ABMI*)
- Process data
- Publish project and send data to [NatureCounts](#canavian) (*Currently supported by the ABMI*)
