Welcome to the protocol for conducting a **digital point count** using an autonomous recording unit or handheld recording device. In collaboration with a multitude of [partners](#acknowledgements), this user-friendly protocol aims to establish a standard method for collecting data on avian populations in a digital format, making it accessible and easy for citizen scientists to collect and contribute to avian research and population monitoring.

The use of autonomous recording units (ARUs) and handheld recording devices in avian point counts, in partnership with leading avian research organizations, provides a standardized protocol for data collection that ensures consistency and comparability of results following established guidelines. The data is collected in a digital format, which makes it easily accessible and shareable among researchers from various organizations. Citizen scientists can participate in avian research, regardless of prior experience or expertise, and contribute to scientific knowledge. The program is designed to be user-friendly, for all skill levels, with support and guidance from experts.

## The Basics {.unnumbered}

**1) Select a protocol and equipment**

- [Select a point count protocol](#download-cheatsheets) for conducting a digital point count
- [Select a recorder model](#selecting-a-recorder) and prepare equipment
- [Select a recording method](), either *continuous* or *segmented*

**2) Conduct the surveys**
