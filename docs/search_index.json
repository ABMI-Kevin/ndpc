"],["overview-and-scope.html", "Chapter 1 Overview and Scope", " Chapter 1 Overview and Scope Large-scale monitoring programs are an effective way to detect changes and trends in animal populations, to foster collaborative initiatives and to improve monitoring and evaluation (Stern et al. 2005). There are several approaches that can be effective for monitoring wild birds in Canada. One approach is to conduct regular surveys of bird populations at specific locations, such as wetlands, forests, or grasslands. These surveys can be carried out by trained volunteers or professional biologists, and can involve visual observations, bird counts, and the use of recording equipment to capture bird sounds. Another approach is to use citizen science programs, where members of the public can report their observations of wild birds to a central database. This can provide valuable information on the distribution and abundance of different bird species in Canada. Additionally, conservation organizations and government agencies often have programs in place to monitor wild birds and their habitats, and can provide valuable resources for those interested in monitoring wild birds in Canada. The North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) is a long-term, road-based survey designed to collect quantitative data on avian population trends across the continent (Hudson et al. 2017). Provincial atlases aim to collect data from volunteers, researchers, consultants, NGOs and the provincial and federal government in partnerships to assess the current status of breeding birds and to map their distribution and relative abundance at the provincial scale (Cadman et al. 1987) and through time as atlases are repeated. Results from both of these sources drive decision-making, conservation policy and planning and provide indicators for environmental and climate change in Canada. Augmentation of avian data collection with autonomous recording units (ARUs) along traditional survey routes has the potential to increase detection rates, reduce false positives by human observers, as well as more easily increase sampling in remote locations (Pankratz et al. 2017). Acoustic technology is becoming increasingly affordable (Shonfield et al. 2017) allowing researchers and the public to actively collect high quality acoustic information about the environment. The differences between humans and ARUs for avian surveys is well-studied (Darras et al. 2018, Pankratz et al. 2017, Shonfield and Bayne 2017, Van Wilgenburg et al. 2017, Venier et al. 2017, Turgeon et al. 2017, Yip et al. 2019), but how to most effectively use both in a large-scale, long-term monitoring program is less understood. Establishing a standardized method to actively record the environment while simultaneously conducting point counts could significantly augment the data quality and integrity of breeding bird survey data where needed. Where possible, integrating the most accurate point count and acoustic species processing with point count survey data could synthesise an improved protocol towards avian monitoring in Canada making it more accessible to citizen scientists to collect avian data without having to be an expert. Data quality augmentation can occur by aligning metadata such as location accuracy, anthropogenic and geophonic events with observed species detections from point counts.

This project will use the Zoom H2N and Wildlife Acoustics SM4 models of ARUs due to availability, ease of use, and durability against the environment. Properly calibrating and testing ARUs prior to conducting a mobile ARU survey ensures its success and resulting high quality acoustic data (see Bioacoustic Unit Maintenance and Deployment Protocol for standards and recommendations). Table 1 summarises the major types of ARU models available on the market with some details on specifications. These recommendations come from a synthesis of information from Russell, 2021 and the Bioacoustic Unit. Prepare equipment and settings Zoom H2N Technical Setup The most recent firmware is also strongly recommended for the Zoom H2N is 3.0 and can be found here: https://zoomcorp.com/en/ca/handheld-recorders/handheld-recorders/h2n-handy-recorder/h2n-support/. Additional equipment required are USB cables, SD cards, batteries, a windsock and a tripod. Table 2 - Technical setup of the Zoom H2N recorder. Photos Description Turn on the device using the POWER switch. Press the MENU button, toggle the PLAY button up/down and then press down to select SYSTEM. Select DATE/TIME. Use the PLAY button to select and modify the year, day, month, and time settings as needed. When all settings are correct, select OK and press the PLAY button to exit. Ensure that FILE NAME (under REC settings) is set to DATE so that individual files will be named by the date/time of the start of recording). Do not use DEFAULT. Ensure the recorder has sufficient battery power to record all counts (and pack at least 2 spare AA batteries). Ensure that there is a memory-card inserted with sufficient space (the bottom-right corner of the unit’s screen indicates the remaining time on the SD card). Ensure the recorder uses the following settings: 2CH selected on channel selector dial MIC GAIN set to 10 (maximum) SURROUND is set to S±0 (this is really easy to change by accident, because it is changed by moving the PLAY lever while in RECORD mode) REC FORMAT is set at WAV (when you turn on the recorder, the REC format is displayed on the lower left [e.g., 44.1/16]– if it doesn’t match, go to MENU to change it under REC settings) Use 44.1kHz/16 bit (there are other wav settings that would also work but use a little or a lot more memory). Do not use MP3 AUTO REC is OFF Under INPUT LO CUT is ON (may be useful to reduce impacts of wind or traffic noise) COMP/LIMITER is OFF AUTO GAIN is off Table 3 - Settings for the Zoom H2N Menu Setting Value 2CH MS Side Level 0 (120 degrees) Input Setting Lo Cut On Comp/Limiter Off Monitor Home and Rec Auto gain Off Plug-in Power Off Rec Rec Format WAV44.1kHz/16bit Auto Rec Off Pre Rec Off File Name Date and time Play Key Function Off Spatial audio Off SM4 Technical Setup Table 4 - Technical setup of the Wildlife Acoustics SM4 ARU. Table 5 - Settings for the Wildlife Acoustics SM4 ARU. Conduct the survey protocol This next section outlines the mobile survey protocol in the field. Equipment setup Arrive at the survey location. Follow any safety instructions or measures outlined by your respective point count protocol (e.g. BBS, atlas) Ensure at the beginning of each survey to place the ARU at a fixed place, a minimum distance of 5 metres away from the observer, to minimize observer sounds, but a maximum distance of 20 metres away, to minimize error between the detection radius of the ARU and observer. A tripod or stable surface is recommended to support the ARU; do not place the recorder on or near a vehicle as it will pick up vibrations that could mask species detections. Placing the recorder to the rear of the vehicle can also minimise the sounds made from a vehicle engine (e.g. car, truck, quad, etc.) after it is shut off. Recorder activation and voicestamp Initiate the survey by hitting the RECORD button (same type of button for the Zoom H2N and Wildlife Acoustics SM4) Speak a message into the recorder to serve as the voicestamp. A location name or spatial coordinates or identifier must be provided. Speak as clearly as possible. Table 6 - Speech instructions and metadata steps during the voicestamp Speech User Action Purpose Optional Hit Record Initiates the recording Observer name Speech Indicates who recorded the survey No Location (e.g. name or spatial coordinates) Speech Provides a spatial coordinate to the media No Date and time Speech Provides a temporal stamp for the media Yes Move 5-20 metres away from recorder Reduces noise made by the observer START Speech Provides the end point of the speech-to-text recognizer No Conduct the survey for the duration indicated by project design. If you need to stop during the survey for traffic, do not turn off the unit until the end of the extended survey (see next section) Do not to speak during the survey to limit erroneous speech errors picked up by the speech-to-text recognizer At the end of the count, speak STOP. Recorder deactivation Turn off the recorder and move to the next location. Repeat steps as necessary to conduct more surveys along a route Adjust survey length for anthropogenic or geophonic conditions Surveys may occur along roadsides or near areas of loud anthropogenic noise. In order to optimize species detections in the detection radius of the ARU, survey time can be extended by 1 minute per traffic event up to maximum survey length time of 10 minutes. It’s recommended to keep a stopwatch or phone timer set to the length of the survey interval, and the maximum survey interval so you don’t have to keep track of the traffic events specifically but rather the time you can survey for. Geophonic events are similar. If it becomes too windy or rainy to continue the survey, i.e. if geophonic events last for &gt;10 minutes during the survey, the media will be considered “Bad Weather”. However, surveys can be extended for 1 minute at a time for intermittent periods of rain or wind. Run the speech-to-text recognizer During the deployment of the ARU, the field technician records a voice note as the initial recording. The voice note has the following format: Location name Spatial coordinates* (not applicable for Ecosystem Health locations) Date and time Observers Comments “This is A B M I dash Five Six Five dash S W. The date is February 23rd 2022 and the time is 11:06 AM Mountain standard time. Observers are John Doe and Jane Doe.” A speech-to-text recognizer is used to transcribe this into text information in order to extract the location name, spatial coordinates or confirm the temporal stamp of the ARU, all for quality control purposes. The Google Cloud Speech-to-Text recognizer is an advanced deep learning neural network using algorithms for automatic speech recognition. The recognizer can also use one of several machine learning models to transcribe the audio files, support for French and other language variants, and alternatives based on likelihood values. Google has trained these speech recognition models for specific audio types and sources. For example, time stamps derived from the observer speech-to-text array as well as the recording time stamp from the audio would be joined into to create a unique location and recording date with the file prefix from the ARU. Some general steps to get started would be to: Create a lookup table for the locations or spatial coordinates. This can be generated by downloading a list of location names or coordinates entered from WildTrax either in the organization or the project (see Location Management) Run the script and instruct the prompts what settings and files you want to use as inputs Folder with audio files Matching threshold (0 - 100, where 100 is a perfect match) Length of desired trimmed files (in seconds) Output file name for csv results Upload the trimmed media to WildTrax Once the recordings are trimmed to the correct length of time Bioacoustic Unit staff will upload them to WildTrax. Go to My Data -&gt; My Projects and search for the appropriate project for your data. Follow the WildTrax protocols on getting data uploaded to a project. 2.1 Roadside protocol and procedures 2.1.1 Breeding Bird Surveys 2.1.2 Bioacoustic Unit Surveys 2.2 Off-road protocol and procedures 2.2.1 Atlas Off-road Surveys "],["analysis.html", "Chapter 3 Analysis", " Chapter 3 Analysis "],["discussion.html", "Chapter 4 Discussion", " Chapter 4 Discussion DISCUSSION The protocol outlined above provides a standardized method for conducting digital avian point counts using ARUs or handheld recording devices. By integrating acoustic technology with traditional point count surveys, this protocol has the potential to significantly augment the data quality and integrity of avian monitoring programs in Canada. Some considerations for further improvement and review of this protocol are: Validation of the effectiveness of ARUs in detecting bird species compared to human observers. It would be beneficial to conduct validation studies to compare the accuracy and reliability of ARUs with human observers in detecting bird species during point count surveys. This could help establish the confidence level in using ARUs as a reliable method for data collection. Standardization of data processing and analysis methods. As the use of ARUs for avian monitoring is a relatively new approach, there may be variations in data processing and analysis methods among different research groups or monitoring programs. It would be useful to establish standardized methods for processing and analyzing acoustic data, including the use of speech-to-text recognizers, to ensure consistency and comparability of results across different studies or programs. Training and capacity-building for citizen scientists. The use of ARUs in avian monitoring has the potential to involve citizen scientists in data collection efforts, but it may also require training and capacity-building to ensure accurate data collection and recording. Providing resources, training materials, and support for citizen scientists who participate in digital avian point counts could help improve the quality and reliability of the data collected. Regular updates and improvements to equipment and technology. As technology evolves, there may be new advancements in ARUs or other recording devices that could improve the quality and efficiency of data collection. Regular updates and improvements to equipment and technology should be considered to ensure that the most current and effective tools are being used for avian monitoring efforts. CONCLUSION The protocol for conducting digital avian point counts using ARUs or handheld recording devices outlined in this document provides a standardized method for integrating acoustic technology with traditional point count surveys for avian monitoring in Canada. By following this protocol, data quality and integrity can be augmented, and the accessibility of avian monitoring to citizen scientists can be improved. However, further validation, standardization, training, and updates to technology should be considered for continuous improvement of the protocol.
