<p>Select a recorder model
ARUs must be affordable, available and easy to use to be used in a large-scale program such as BBS or an Atlas. This project will use the Zoom H2N and Wildlife Acoustics SM4 models of ARUs due to availability, ease of use, and durability against the environment. Properly calibrating and testing ARUs prior to conducting a mobile ARU survey ensures its success and resulting high quality acoustic data (see Bioacoustic Unit Maintenance and Deployment Protocol for standards and recommendations). Table 1 summarises the major types of ARU models available on the market with some details on specifications. These recommendations come from a synthesis of information from Russell, 2021 and the Bioacoustic Unit.</p>
<p>Prepare equipment and settings
Zoom H2N Technical Setup</p>
<p>The most recent firmware is also strongly recommended for the Zoom H2N is 3.0 and can be found here: <a href="https://zoomcorp.com/en/ca/handheld-recorders/handheld-recorders/h2n-handy-recorder/h2n-support/" class="uri">https://zoomcorp.com/en/ca/handheld-recorders/handheld-recorders/h2n-handy-recorder/h2n-support/</a>. Additional equipment required are USB cables, SD cards, batteries, a windsock and a tripod.</p>

Description</p>
<p>Turn on the device using the POWER switch.</p>
<p>Press the MENU button, toggle the PLAY button up/down and then press down to select SYSTEM.</p>
<p>Select DATE/TIME.</p>
<p>Use the PLAY button to select and modify the year, day, month, and time settings as needed.</p>
<p>When all settings are correct, select OK and press the PLAY button to exit.</p>
<p>Ensure that FILE NAME (under REC settings) is set to DATE so that individual files will be named by the date/time of the start of recording). Do not use DEFAULT.</p>
<p>Ensure the recorder has sufficient battery power to record all counts (and pack at least 2 spare AA batteries).</p>
<p>Ensure that there is a memory-card inserted with sufficient space (the bottom-right corner of the unit’s screen indicates the remaining time on the SD card).</p>
<p>Ensure the recorder uses the following settings:
2CH selected on channel selector dial
MIC GAIN set to 10 (maximum)
SURROUND is set to S±0 (this is really easy to change by accident, because it is changed by moving the PLAY lever while in RECORD mode)
REC FORMAT is set at WAV (when you turn on the recorder, the REC format is displayed on the lower left [e.g., 44.1/16]– if it doesn’t match, go to MENU to change it under REC settings)
Use 44.1kHz/16 bit (there are other wav settings that would also work but use a little or a lot more memory). Do not use MP3
AUTO REC is OFF
Under INPUT
LO CUT is ON (may be useful to reduce impacts of wind or traffic noise)
COMP/LIMITER is OFF

<p>Conduct the survey protocol
This next section outlines the mobile survey protocol in the field.</p>
<p>Equipment setup
Arrive at the survey location. Follow any safety instructions or measures outlined by your respective point count protocol (e.g. BBS, atlas)
Ensure at the beginning of each survey to place the ARU at a fixed place, a minimum distance of 5 metres away from the observer, to minimize observer sounds, but a maximum distance of 20 metres away, to minimize error between the detection radius of the ARU and observer.
A tripod or stable surface is recommended to support the ARU; do not place the recorder on or near a vehicle as it will pick up vibrations that could mask species detections.
Placing the recorder to the rear of the vehicle can also minimise the sounds made from a vehicle engine (e.g. car, truck, quad, etc.) after it is shut off.</p>
<p>Recorder activation and voicestamp
Initiate the survey by hitting the RECORD button (same type of button for the Zoom H2N and Wildlife Acoustics SM4)
Speak a message into the recorder to serve as the voicestamp. A location name or spatial coordinates or identifier must be provided. Speak as clearly as possible.</p>

<p>Conduct the survey for the duration indicated by project design. If you need to stop during the survey for traffic, do not turn off the unit until the end of the extended survey (see next section)
Do not to speak during the survey to limit erroneous speech errors picked up by the speech-to-text recognizer
At the end of the count, speak STOP.</p>
<p>Recorder deactivation
Turn off the recorder and move to the next location. Repeat steps as necessary to conduct more surveys along a route</p>
<p>Adjust survey length for anthropogenic or geophonic conditions
Surveys may occur along roadsides or near areas of loud anthropogenic noise. In order to optimize species detections in the detection radius of the ARU, survey time can be extended by 1 minute per traffic event up to maximum survey length time of 10 minutes. It’s recommended to keep a stopwatch or phone timer set to the length of the survey interval, and the maximum survey interval so you don’t have to keep track of the traffic events specifically but rather the time you can survey for. Geophonic events are similar. If it becomes too windy or rainy to continue the survey, i.e. if geophonic events last for &gt;10 minutes during the survey, the media will be considered “Bad Weather”. However, surveys can be extended for 1 minute at a time for intermittent periods of rain or wind.</p>
<p>Run the speech-to-text recognizer
During the deployment of the ARU, the field technician records a voice note as the initial recording. The voice note has the following format:
Location name
Spatial coordinates* (not applicable for Ecosystem Health locations)
Date and time
Observers
Comments
“This is A B M I dash Five Six Five dash S W. The date is February 23rd 2022 and the time is 11:06 AM Mountain standard time. Observers are John Doe and Jane Doe.”
A speech-to-text recognizer is used to transcribe this into text information in order to extract the location name, spatial coordinates or confirm the temporal stamp of the ARU, all for quality control purposes. The Google Cloud Speech-to-Text recognizer is an advanced deep learning neural network using algorithms for automatic speech recognition. The recognizer can also use one of several machine learning models to transcribe the audio files, support for French and other language variants, and alternatives based on likelihood values. Google has trained these speech recognition models for specific audio types and sources. For example, time stamps derived from the observer speech-to-text array as well as the recording time stamp from the audio would be joined into to create a unique location and recording date with the file prefix from the ARU. Some general steps to get started would be to:
Create a lookup table for the locations or spatial coordinates. This can be generated by downloading a list of location names or coordinates entered from WildTrax either in the organization or the project (see Location Management)
Run the script and instruct the prompts what settings and files you want to use as inputs
Folder with audio files
Matching threshold (0 - 100, where 100 is a perfect match)
Length of desired trimmed files (in seconds)
Output file name for csv results</p>
<p>Upload the trimmed media to WildTrax
Once the recordings are trimmed to the correct length of time Bioacoustic Unit staff will upload them to WildTrax. Go to My Data -&gt; My Projects and search for the appropriate project for your data. Follow the WildTrax protocols on getting data uploaded to a project.</p>
